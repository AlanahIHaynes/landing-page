Learning Project, From Scratch and Using Flex

This is my first website from scratch.
It is an Assignment from the Odin Project to help build my skills.
I now have knowledge of basic HTML/CSS and features like Flex.

Odin provides a guiding image, I am aiming to recreate, but I will be adding my personal info and design to the website.

Cheers to more learning!
